## 🌟 Goals for the Class

- Discover our niche, or whether a topic truly interests us, as we try to reproduce a research paper in the realm of networking.  
- Gain the confidence and requisite knowledge to embark on reading any research paper.  
- Grow as programmers and researchers in designing and executing a reproduction of a research project.  
- Feel more comfortable with starting coding projects from zero and defining the requirements of such projects ourselves.

---

## ✅ Past Team Assignments Experience

**Positive:**
- Keely and Hannah successfully wrote a research paper together and they’re still friends.  
- Hannah and L’Hussen got through CS112 together and are still friends.  
- Lara’s group project for CS356 went well and smoothly — and we are still friends!

**Challenges:**
- When people have different time priorities and expectations for time spent on the project.  
- Making sure work is evenly distributed between team members.  
- Being able to talk about issues the group may be having (e.g., tardiness, unresponsiveness, etc.).
