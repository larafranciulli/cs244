# Team Red-Tailed Hawk



(from left to right: L’hussen, Keely, Lara, Hannah)

Goals for the class
Discover our niche, or whether a topic truly interests us, as we try to reproduce a research paper in the realm of networking.
Gain the confidence and requisite knowledge to embark on reading any research paper.
Grow as programmers and researchers in designing and executing a reproduction of a research project.
Feel more comfortable with starting coding projects from zero and defining the requirements of such projects ourselves.

Past Team Assignments Experience
Positive:
Keely and Hannah successfully wrote a research paper together and they’re still friends
Hannah and L’hussen got through 112 together and are still friends
Lara’s group project for CS 356 went well and smoothly, and we are still friends

Challenges:
When people have different time priorities and expectations for time spent on the project. 
Making sure work is evenly distributed between team members. 
Being able to talk about issues the group may be having (tardiness, unresponsiveness, etc.).

Team Charter


Who are your team members?
Keely Podosin (she/her), Hannah Dunn (she/her), Lara Franciulli (she/her), L’Hussen Touré (he/him)

What is your team mascot?

 Red-Tailed Hawk - fierce, intelligent, watchful, stately

How will the team celebrate triumphs?
We’ll get ice cream together to celebrate big milestones! We can also occasionally jacuzzi at Keely’s off-campus apartment for other big milestones.

How will the team make important decisions? 
Team consensus is ideal but if the discussions get to be too long or difficult (half an hour of conversation depending on the context) we will put it to a vote.

How will the team resolve conflicts and discuss problems?
Talk it through! Any group member who is uninvolved can help mediate said conflict.

Leadership: What does “leadership” mean to your team?
Leadership has a lot of different meanings! Some of them include: 
Listening to feedback
All voices are equally valued, and no one monopolizes discussion
Asking for help/delegating
Being kind
Leading by example and making valuable contributions to the team. 
Keeping the group accountable and the project on track

Who is the person that hits “submit” on your reports and milestones? The one who crosses the “t”s and dots the “i”s? You can assign different people to be in charge of different reports and milestones, but it helps to have a clear person in charge for each one.
Submitter and Secretary: Keely 
Final t-crosser and i-dotter: L’Hussen

When will the team meet as a group each week? Please be precise.
Mondays, Wednesdays 3-4pm in person with ad hoc meetings over Zoom as needed
Regular syncs over iMessage

What will be the procedure for missing or being late to this meeting? How much advance notice must be given and using what method? (We recommend that last-minute text messaging is not used to inform team members that a member will be late or miss a meeting.)
Team is most responsive via iMessage, so a message to our group text chat with as much notice as possible is preferred so we can potentially reschedule a meeting. If a team member is less than 5 minutes late no notice is necessary. We will do our best to make sure everyone is able to attend every team meeting.

How will you design your software so people can work independently, through stable and well-defined interfaces?
GitHub

What area(s) of networking research will you explore?
There are a few different areas of networking we are interested in exploring. A few are below: 
CDNs, limiting internet traversal
Interested in working on something privacy or censorship related - maybe could involve use of proxies as a networking concept? 
Protocol design - minimizing retransmission rates, improving reliability in delivery
We will take this weekend to each find 3 examples of papers that we would be interested in replicating. We will then meet to vote or reach a consensus on the paper we will replicate.
